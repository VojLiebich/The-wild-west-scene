## The-wild-west-scene...file in this document
As outcome of this project should be realistic wild west saloon bar model and textures in blender, one animation in that environment and few renders-(just pictures)
I´m sorry for complications but the file is too big for uplouding it here on GitHub so I will put here link on my drive, for dowloading....
# Here is the blend. file:    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X8s1Qrc2EZZy8eEQg5c7W9GR77QVVZZH/view?usp=sharing
# Here is the stl. file:   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I-rQMUi3hqc9G1a51LTEDE6MgENEXhdI/view?usp=sharing
Every session I will make here as a number.. 
The project will be separated to 3 main parts:
1.modeling
2.texturing
3.rendering and animating
And one more problem, I don´t know how to add textures to the blend file so you will see the textures just in the screenshots of the sessions.
Also sorry,I can´t provide the sessions will be 100% accurate to the sessions ,but definitely most of them will be correct. The missing or incorrect hours are definitely posted in the threads on the Slack application.
If is something wrong with with this documentation write me please on slack-Thanks:-)
